Talking with my classmate helped me figur eout how to approach coding in java.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Monday 3-4 with Jordan
Jordan helped me change the while loop I initally had in my function to a for loop which made coding the rest of this project easier.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
The syntax is so complicated. I think due to the fact that it is less similar to english and I'm less fmailiar with it, I can't conceptualise my ideas or implement them in Java quite yet which is what lead me to writing the code in python then translating it to python.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Python is way closer to english than Java so its harder to code in it for me personally.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I wrote down in comments the first small steps I wanted to take such as having a variable for the number of conversations I wanted to have and wrote that down in code. I tried to continues but I didnt have a very clear plan so thats what I did next.

I started writing the program in python so that it would be easier to write in java since python is essentially usable pseudo code. 

At first I tried doing everything in the while loop but then I decided to make two functions. One for canned responses and one for the mirror responses.

I tried using "thinking" as a marker for where to change the mirror words but but the I realised that that would not work if the entered phrase did not have thinking in it.

Created two lists of the mirror words and used if statements to iterate through them then combined the changed words at the end.

My loop was going one extra iteration so I did convonumber - 1

To print transcript, I appeneded the stuff I was ouputting to a list then used a for loop to print the list.

Recommendation:
Coding has been happening for a long time. Someone on the internet has had a similar problem to you and you can learn from what they did.
